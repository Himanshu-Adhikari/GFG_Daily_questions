Q:
Given an positive integer n, find a subset of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive), where each number can be used at most once, such that:

The XOR of all elements in the subset is exactly n.
The size of the subset is as large as possible.
If multiple such subsets exist, choose the lexicographically smallest one.
Lexicographical Order : A subset A[] is lexicographically smaller than subset B[] if at the first index where they differ, A[i] < B[i] (based on character ASCII/Unicode values).
If all elements match but one subset ends earlier, the shorter subset is considered smaller

Ans:
supoose we have [1,2] its current xor is 3 but i need 2 so what is i want to delete 3^2=1
so just xor everything then xor with what u want and then release it from [1...n]
