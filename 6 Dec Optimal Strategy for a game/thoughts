You are given an integer array arr[] of size n(even). The array elements represent n coins of values v1, v2, ....vn.
You play against an opponent in an alternating way. In each turn, a player selects either the first or last coin from the row, removes it from the row permanently, and receives the coin's value.
You need to determine the maximum possible amount of money you can win if you go first.
Note: Both the players are playing optimally.

Ans:
in one case either the user will pick from the remaining length selections either ends
so in case its 1 i mean the currrent player is blocked from taking then we need to minimise the 
ans or sum that the user can't pick and if the stat is 0 i.e user can pick then we should maximise the 
ans
